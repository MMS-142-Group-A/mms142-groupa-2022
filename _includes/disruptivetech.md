                        Disruptive technology is not about upgrading services or products, which is what sustaining innovation is all about. Disruptive innovation is about making new services or products that are simple and cheap that meet the needs of customers, which makes them more available in the market. E-commerce is like that. Compared to physical shopping establishments, it offers accessibility to transactions making it simple, which is what customers need. The simplicity and accessibility of E-commerce are evident through…

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      The rise of e-commerce created a drastic change in consumer behavior. It is within the consumer’s control “where, when, and how to shop” (ESW 2022) as they are no longer tied to concepts such as “shopping hours'' or “shop locations” of physical establishments that the consumers have to meet in order to create transactions. When people come to online platforms, they know that they also have access to specific products that they know are not available on physical establishments due to the wider options and scope that e-commerce provides. Especially when they are the “busy” type and have no time to  wander around the mall, they can count on e-commerce without leaving the house (Meteor Space 2022). 
                    </p>
                    <img src="insert image" alt="">
                    <p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp      With the consumer at the center of the system, the expectations of the consumers have also shifted. Similar to other online platforms, e-commerce is a learning system made to cater individuals by learning from their activity within the interface in order to create a mindset that the shopping experience should be a personalized one. Such subconscious influence to their mindset creates a greater expectation of consumers to companies and other shops to make their experience personalized (ESW 2022). 
<br>
<br/>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Lastly, e-commerce has altered shopping to be a social activity for the consumers packaged in a form similar to the social media experience. Rather than taking brands at face value or how the brand advertise themselves, consumers are more trusting of the reviews of products that strangers provide. Because of the social engagements that happen within e-commerce platforms, consumers are making more informed decisions on buying particular products from different brands and shops (ESW 2022). On the other hand, impulse buying was recorded worldwide to spike due to the online platform, especially since there were discount or voucher strategies that were implemented (Dujardin, 2022)

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp       Due to e-commerce, business models are shifted to include or switch to e-commerce platforms apart from their physical store-front shops. Scaling up one’s business has never been easier and cheaper before, compared to up-keeping physical brick-and-mortar establishments. Additionally, the customers themselves act as the business’s advertiser through reviews and self-searching wherein e-commerce platform algorithms advertise the products to their users for “free”.
<br>
<br>                      
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  E-commerce has allowed businesses to operate 24 hours a day and be accessible to wider range of consumers from distant places (Morris 2021), giving the business more flexibility and a bigger customer population pool. One huge benefit of e-commerce was the ability of companies to penetrate the international market. Through online shopping platforms, local businesses can offer their products to international consumers and have them delivered (Kiran, 2020). Thus, instead of the traditional way of being a multinational company, firms today have a more convenient way in pursuit of growth.
<br>
<br>                   
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   On the other hand, data collection features in e-commerce platforms provide business owners with statistical data about consumers that they can use to scout what products are the most or least popular in their shops. They can also use this data to improve their marketing strategy by including popular keywords related to their product to give them a boost in web searchability. Data collection is then improving the ability of businesses to listen to what the customers want (Liqui-site 2020).

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    Transactions are becoming more flexible because of e-commerce, consumers are much smarter because of ability to compare prices of similar products from different shops that are instantly available in one platform instead of canvassing them separately. Meanwhile, businesses are forced to open up several payment methods to accommodate the preferences of each consumer (Dey, 2022).

                    <p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Business owners do not need a physical store to conduct business and those that switch to online platforms are leaving behind a lot of vacancies from their previous locations (e.g. shopping malls, renting spaces). These malls that used to house businesses are not exactly receiving regression, rather they are predicted to adapt to the changes brought up by e-commerce. According to Kodali (2022), these malls will shift to hosting more physical service-based businesses instead of product-based shops. Product-based shops either switch to e-commerce or exist in both e-commerce and physical stores, thus the establishment will cater these type of tenants. Malls will adapt by welcoming more occupants that will use the spaces for civic activity offices, hair salons, clinics (for people/pets), gyms, and other in person services to fill in the vacant spaces. In return, it will change how people envisioned malls and those of the similar operational industry.
